# advent-of-code

I am doing some of the 2022 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles as a way to amuse my high school students, and may be doing some of them later with my sons as a way to amuse each other. I'm putting my solutions out here as a way to amuse you! Feel free to add comments or questions in the Issues section.
